	  This driver adds support for the PolarFire SoC (MPFS) system controller.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. the
	  module will be called mpfs_system_controller.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  These drivers add support for the syscons on PolarFire SoC (MPFS).
	  Without these drivers core parts of the kernel such as clocks
	  and resets will not function correctly.

	  If unsure, and on a PolarFire SoC, say y.
