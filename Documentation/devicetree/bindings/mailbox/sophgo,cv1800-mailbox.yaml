description:
  The Sophgo cv18x SoCs mailbox has 8 channels and 8 bytes per channel for
  different processors. Any processer can write data in a channel, and
  set co-responding register to raise interrupt to notice another processor,
  and it is allowed to send data to itself.
  Sophgo cv18x SoCs has 3 processors and numbered as
  <1> C906L
  <2> C906B
  <3> 8051
