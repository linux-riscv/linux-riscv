Description:	Minimum frequency the CPUs belonging to this policy are allowed

Description:	This attribute returns the last frequency requested by the
		limits (in kHz) or can be written to in order to set a new
		fixed frequency. If different from 0, then the PWC will try to
		operate the DPA at this specific frequency. If written to 0, the
		PWC will operate the DPA between ``scaling_max_freq`` and
		``scaling_min_freq`` according to the
		``energy_performance_preference`` configuration.
